# Workflow for a pure Elm project to be deployed to GitHub pages.
#
#
# To test locally, install act (https://github.com/nektos/act).
# E.g. on Windows via
#  $ choco install docker-desktop
#  $ choco install act-cli
# and then reboot.
#
# The workflow may be run simply by calling
#  $ act
# 
# Note: Jobs/steps with the condition `!env.ACT` will not run.
